##QA Process

1. The result does not reach the DoD
   - The story will be pulled back to TODO with the test results in the comments

2. There is a bug that is not defined in the DoD
   - The story will be considered DONE and the QA should create a new ""Bug"" ticket in the sprint

3. There is something that is not defined in the DoD but it is not a bug (something that the team agrees that should be implemented to improve the quality)
   - A new ""Story"" should be created and given points.

4. There is something that cannot be tested yet due to 3rd parties.
   - A new ""Task"" should be created to keep track that it has not been tested.

** Every story has to implement UnitTest as a default DoD. Except for projects that cannot add the tests and need to be refactored first."
